- 👋 Hi, I’m @HopefulDandelion
- 👀 I’m interested in reprofiling myself. Currently student at chemistry faculty, also interested in all kinds of art forms, but in the end I think coding stole my heart :))
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of programming. Very excited to dive deeper :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects, where I can actively learn and improve my coding skills
